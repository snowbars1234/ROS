CREATING A CATKIN PACKAGE


This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new catkin package, and what you can do with it after it has been created.

First change to the source space directory of the catkin workspace you created in the Creating a Workspace for catkin tutorial:


# You should have created this in the Creating a Workspace Tutorial
	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
Now use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package called 'beginner_tutorials' which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:


	$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
This will create a beginner_tutorials folder which contains a package.xml and a CMakeLists.txt, which have been partially filled out with the information you gave catkin_create_pkg.

catkin_create_pkg requires that you give it a package_name and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends:


# This is an example, do not try to run this
# catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
catkin_create_pkg also has more advanced functionalities which are described in catkin/commands/catkin_create_pkg.


BUILDING A CATKIN WORKSPACE AND SOURCING THE SETUP FILE


Now you need to build the packages in the catkin workspace:


$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make



To add the workspace to your ROS environment you need to source the generated setup file:


$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
